# SQL Learning Journey

This repository documents my **step-by-step journey learning SQL from scratch**, with a focus on **data analysis and data science use cases**.

The goal of this repo is not just to store final results, but to **show the learning process**, daily practice, and gradual improvement over time.

---

## What this repository contains

* Daily SQL practice files (organized by day)
* Notes on SQL concepts and best practices
* Hands-on queries for real analytical scenarios
* A clear progression from **basic queries** to **advanced analytical SQL**

---

## Topics Covered (and planned)

* Basic SQL queries (`SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`)
* Filtering and aggregation (`GROUP BY`, `HAVING`)
* Joins (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`)
* Subqueries and CTEs
* Window functions
* SQL for data analysis and reporting

## Learning Approach

* Learn one concept at a time
* Practice immediately with queries
* Commit progress daily to track improvement
* Focus on **clarity and correctness**, not memorization

---

## Motivation

This repository is part of my broader plan to build strong foundations in:

* Data Science
* Analytics
* Applied Machine Learning

and to prepare for **graduate studies and professional work**.

---

## Progress Tracking

Progress is tracked through:

* Daily commits
* Increasing query complexity
* Refactoring and improving earlier queries

---

## Tools

* SQL (PostgreSQL / SQLite style syntax)
* Git & GitHub
